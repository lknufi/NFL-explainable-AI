## Welcome to the final project in the HCI in AI course about explainable AI for NFL game predictions

As part of this project, we created different explanation methods for ML-based predictions for NFL games and visualized the results. Following up, we conducted a short survey to investigate the viability of the individual explanation methods. The survey can be found [here](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=2zjkx2LkIkypCsNYsWmAs7r7qR2qxCFAjAiZd_O7Xp5UM01PU1FIVjkyN0QwV0NEQkZaVjFYSTNUWS4u)
and see the results of the survey can be found in the *FormsResults.xlsx* excel file.

### These are the contents of this project:
- See *data* folder for the data processing.
- See *visualizations* folder for the finished explanations.
- See *.ipynb* jupyter notebooks for the model predictions and explanation generation.
- See *FormsResults.xlsx* for the survey results.
- See *HCIAI Assignment 5 Explainable AI for NFL.pptx* for our findings and analysis.
