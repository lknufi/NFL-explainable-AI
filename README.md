## Welcome to the final project in the HCI in AI course about explainable AI for NFL game predictions

As part of this project, we created different explanation methods for ML-based predictions for NFL games and visualized the results. Following up, we conducted a short survey to investigate the viability of the individual explanation methods. The survey can be found [here](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=2zjkx2LkIkypCsNYsWmAs7r7qR2qxCFAjAiZd_O7Xp5UM01PU1FIVjkyN0QwV0NEQkZaVjFYSTNUWS4u)
and see the results of the survey can be found in the [FormsResults Excel](FormsResults.xlsx).
